# Heshoo

Hey there! Welcome to ``Heshoo``(``هێشوو`` - ``Hêşû``) – it's a Kurdish word that means grape cluster, those bunches of grapes you find in vineyards.

Each grape cluster has its own mini version called a ``Zangata``(``زەنگەتە`` - ``Zengete``) - Another Kurdish word :) - It's like a tiny cluster of grapes within a cluster, Just a couple of juicy grape berries hanging out together.

But here's where things get fun! This repo is going to be like my vineyard, where I'll be sharing all sorts of technical stuff and challenges that I face. Each blog post is gonna be called a ``Zangata``.

And when you put all these ``Zangata``s together, they make up a ``Heshoo`` – a big collection of blog posts. So let's see how big we can grow this ``Heshoo`` together, shall we?

#### In case you want to know the pronunciations:
- ``Heshoo`` -> /hɛʃu:/
- ``Zangata`` -> /zængætæ/
